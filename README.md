# SOLID Training Project

This project is a practical training on the SOLID principles in Java. It contains examples and exercises for each of the five principles: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.

## Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should only have one job or responsibility.

## Open-Closed Principle

The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle states that no client should be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle deals with the disadvantages of "fat" interfaces.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
